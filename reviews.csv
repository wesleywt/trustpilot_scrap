Bryan White,2019-04-11T19:51:59Z,5,Wanted to Hate Divi,"I had heard bad things about Divi from other marketers, and so I had avoided it. Boy, was I wrong! And what were they talking about?I've spent a few years using other themes and systems, and never quite getting the results I wanted. Finally, after thousands of dollars spent on other themes because they might have this one feature or style, or on different page builders that I've grown to love... well, kind of, anyway. But I was wasting my time and money.So I know how to code my way out of a paper bag so long as it's wet. There have been things I wanted to do on websites that I just couldn't figure out how to make happen. In a few hours working with Divi, I was creating those very visuals that I had figured I would just have to purchase a new theme to make happen. This one theme can now be my go-to in order to create elements that took four or five plugins in the past. Love it!"

When you're running a website you can't wait for a day to have someone even see your request. Then, you get an email sometime in the middle of the night while the problem still exists. Several times emails have come out under Nick's name touting service. Nick should try to get service himself and see what it's like."

Scott Lawrence,2019-02-27T16:59:13Z,5,Divi is the KING when it comes to EASY!,"Divi is the KING when it comes to ease of web design. What used to take a week takes a few hours and now we're all in with our personal goal to convert all of our clients websites to Divi.If you're having trouble with speed, you might want to check into Wordpress Hosting. We can help you with that. Divi is designed for the end user, it's not focused on SEO 100% as they are in the business of easy to use software.If anyone is complaining about Divi they are missing the big picture. We love DIVI :)"

""maybe try this plugin or that plugin or another plug or...."" blablah.FIx your pagespeed issues or provide a pagespeed optimization service!"

There was a small technical issue with my order (bonuses went to spam) and they honored & took accountability for their part in it.

Some of the key modules do not work and there is nothing you can do about it. There has been a few times I have gotten a response back but with a cut and paste answer. Divi could be great but is not, do yourself a favor and stay away."
Arthur Field,2018-12-21T19:42:27Z,1,I just paid almost $200 for their,I just paid almost $200 for their absolutely awful support. There are multiple things wrong with this theme and I have gotten either no answer at all or incomplete answers to my questions. STAY AWAY!
Verb,2018-11-30T16:32:55Z,2,"Ok, but lack of support makes other premium themes a better choice.","Been developing for around a decade, and dealing heavily with all things wordpress.  All in all DIVI is a pretty solid theme, but some of the features they have are not ready for primetime.  Check their support forums to see issues that have gone unanswered for months.Their chat support is currently (11/2018 )  a joke.   You make recieve an answer in a few hours or a few days or not at all.  Not sure why they don't have a ticket support system like almost every other big WP theme framework out there.If you are thinking about using DIVI, I  would highly recommend you check out some other premium themes first.    I personally would recommend JUPITER theme as their support is extremely responsive and their theme is very solid."
Robert Bruce,2018-11-29T03:22:54Z,1,Falsely advertising product elements…,Falsely advertising product elements during black Friday that were not included with the product. Support did not care.
Sean Lazenby,2018-11-12T20:03:00Z,1,Totally absolutely incredibly…,Totally absolutely incredibly monstrously awful.  Their customer support is atrocious their tutorials are wrong and outdated.
Ricky Friend,2018-10-23T11:05:00Z,1,Their support is not only bad - it's nonexistent.,"Their support is not only bad - it basically is not there at all.  You have a chat option, which I waited for over SEVEN hours on, and then gave up.  Now, there is no ""and they lived happily ever after"" ending with these clowns.  Today, it's now over 12 hours and counting - still no response.  Some companies, I truly believe, don't DESERVE to be in business.  Yes, they have good products - but it is a steep leaning curve.  Don't believe this ""create a website in one hour crap.""  Plan on a couple of weeks.  Yes, weeks.  And you better be good at it, because you're not going to get one OUNCE of help from them - except for their FAQs and online docs.  Those are good IF you know what you're doing.  I see their bad reviews for no support go back YEARS here.  Don't fall for the fake ones that say they have great support.  I've never dealt with such an unprofessional company in my life."
Jonathan Shyman,2018-10-09T10:36:42Z,1,"Product is amazing, but support sucks and is not honest","Product is amazing, but support sucksUPDATE: I had to reduce my rating to 1 star. Recently, Elegant Themes responded to my reveiw with the following comment: ""Looking at your Support history we were experiencing higher then normal chat volumes""Sorry, Elegent Themes, but please don't lie. This was not one particular time I opened a chat response, it was dozens and dozens of times. To be honest, most times after not hearing a response for several hours, I post a ""hello?"" just to indicate that I am still waiting and you respond with the same canned message: ''experiencing higher then normal chat volumes"" EXCEPT that you say that near 100% of the time. So it's not an exception, it's the norm. It's one thing to have to wait a long time on live chat, it doesn't say anywhere in your terms that you respond within a certain amount of time. But to then see my review, reply to it with complete lies is really deserving of a 1 star. It shows, all the more so, how poor support and customer appreciation is at Elegant Themes. PLEASE, Elegant Themes, I love DIVI, but stop acting like children. Start being honest with customers, and start offering real live chat support. Thank you!"

Mark Murphy,2018-08-22T02:16:28Z,5,Without a doubt the best theme around…,"Without a doubt the best theme around for the following reasons;1. Price2. Customer support3. Divi member community groups4. Ease of use5. Updates and free content released almost daily it seems6. Training vids on Youtube from Elegant Themes and the community7. The Divi builder itself - blank canvass and it's up to you to use the builder to design whatever you can imagine.I have been in web dev and design for almost a decade but I spent a good 6 months learning every aspect of Divi.To get the most out of this, you should join communities and there are plenty about! Watch, read or do whatever every bit of content you have signed up to learn from.It is possible to build a site in a day as a complete beginner but if you are a design agency, then best to spend the time to get to know this theme inside out.I'm earning an income from producing great websites for my clients.Mark"
Terry Thorpe,2018-08-04T11:35:05Z,5,Divi is awesome!,"Divi is great, fantastic theme that makes Wordpress much easier to work with. Support is also good."
BurningRubb3r,2018-04-12T11:45:02Z,2,Experience stopped at customer service.,"I'm really interested in their service, especially since their license allows it to use the themes multiple times instead of one single time.Too bad I was not even able to purchase this service since they only offer the option to pay by credit card on their lifetime plan.That's really a bummer, and I cannot give more than 2 stars so far, since there is not much more to rate than the support who answered my email, confirming that I'm only able to pay with credit card. They answered very fast tho, so that's at least a promising start.Edit: thanks for the comment. Even though 1.5 years have passed in between my review and your reply.In the meanwhile I already bought the lifetime package. However, the fact that creditcard is the only option, makes no sense. I understand that you do not like PayPal, for dispute reasons and such, but come on, there are more safe ways to pay other than with a liability shift credit card.The service itself works great, no complaints about that. However, the available payment methods are more hilarious than stand up comedy.Same with the fact it took 1.5 years to react to this review."
David Hellings,2018-02-16T12:06:04Z,2,This is going to be tough for founders,"It used to be a great company before. Times passed, founder starts other projects and the service became horrible. I am a lifetime member and feel shame for that."

Steve Kent,2017-09-29T10:00:50Z,1,"Very poor support, slow, not interested.","Very poor support offering from this company.I deal with many web services companies and have worked in this industry for over 25 years, very seldom do I come across a company with such terrible support that compels me to write, Elegant Themes support is a pretty terrible experience.It is now 25 hours since I opened a ticket in their ""community forum"" as this is the only way to contact them. I have yet to receive any acknowledgement of the ticket or anything at all from them.The 7, Avada and X Theme all have proper support functions which answer very quickly and professionally, these guys are the opposite.Avoid these chancers until they deploy a proper grown-up support helpdesk instead of this amateur forum thing where they can ignore the tickets they can't be bothered with."
Alessandro,2016-11-23T09:36:40Z,5,Onestissimi!,"Al di là dell'utilità o del pacchetto scelto (io avevo preso quello a metà, 89€ annui, developer), sono rapidissimi nelle risposte e chiedendo il rimborso non hanno battuto ciglio nel ridarmi ogni centesimo! Il servizio è ottimo, se avessi effettivamente avuto bisogno di quei temi wordpress, l'avrei sicuro rinnovato.I tried the developer in 2015 and it was fantastic, but i needed a refund because i did not longer need (that time) their themes. They did not ask me anything and gave me all my money back! Awesome, i'll be back to Elegant Themes as fast as i can when i will be back on track with Wordpress! Thank you guys!"
